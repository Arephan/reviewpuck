            ## What's this PR doing?

            [Write 2-3 casual sentences explaining what this PR is trying to accomplish. Start with "Hey" or "So" and be conversational, like talking to a friend. Explain the main changes and purpose.]

            ## Review Summary

            [If you found issues worth mentioning, say "⚠️ **Found X things to look at**" where X is the count. Then list them briefly.
            
            If everything looks good, say "✅ **No critical issues found**" followed by a brief positive note.
            
            For minor suggestions that aren't critical, mention them casually like "Could add X for better Y, but not a blocker."]

            Keep it human and friendly. No formal bullet points unless absolutely necessary.
